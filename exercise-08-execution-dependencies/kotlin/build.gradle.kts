// 1. Run without any dependencies defined
// ./gradlew -q action
// -> consumer gets null, since it executes as first; executiong tasks in alphanumeric order

// 2. Add dependencies - see consumer build script

// Good practices - decoupled projects
// * Avoid a subprojectâ€™s build script referencing other subprojects; preferring cross configuration from the root project.
// * Avoid changing the configuration of other projects at execution time.
